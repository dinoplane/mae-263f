abstract = {The bottle-neck in most cloth simulation systems is that time steps must be small to avoid numerical instability. This paper describes a cloth simulation system that can stably take large time steps. The simulation systemcouples a new technique for enforcing constraints on individual cloth particles with an implicit integration method. The simulator models cloth as a triangular mesh, with internal cloth forces derived using a simple continuum formulation that supports modeling operations such as local anisotropic stretch or compression; a unified treatment of damping forces is included as well. The implicit integration method generates a large, unbanded sparse linear system at each time step which is solved using a modified conjugate gradient method that simultaneously enforces particles' constraints. The constraints are always maintained exactly, independent of the number of conjugate gradient iterations, which is typically small. The resulting simulation system is significantly faster than previous accounts of cloth simulation systems in the literature.},

abstract = {We present a general framework for the garment animation problem through unsupervised deep learning inspired in physically based simulation. Existing trends in the literature already explore this possibility. Nonetheless, these approaches do not handle cloth dynamics. Here, we propose the first methodology able to learn realistic cloth dynamics unsupervisedly, and henceforth, a general formulation for neural cloth simulation. The key to achieve this is to adapt an existing optimization scheme for motion from simulation based methodologies to deep learning. Then, analyzing the nature of the problem, we devise an architecture able to automatically disentangle static and dynamic cloth subspaces by design. We will show how this improves model performance. Additionally, this opens the possibility of a novel motion augmentation technique that greatly improves generalization. Finally, we show it also allows to control the level of motion in the predictions. This is a useful, never seen before, tool for artists. We provide of detailed analysis of the problem to establish the bases of neural cloth simulation and guide future research into the specifics of this domain.},

abstract = {The theory of elasticity describes deformable materials such as rubber, cloth, paper, and flexible metals. We employ elasticity theory to construct differential equations that model the behavior of non-rigid curves, surfaces, and solids as a function of time. Elastically deformable models are active: they respond in a natural way to applied forces, constraints, ambient media, and impenetrable obstacles. The models are fundamentally dynamic and realistic animation is created by numerically solving their underlying differential equations. Thus, the description of shape and the description of motion are unified.},

abstract = {Computation of bending forces on triangle meshes is required for numerous simulation and geometry processing applications. In particular it is a key component in cloth simulation. A common quantity in many bending models is the hinge angle between two adjacent triangles. This angle is straightforward to compute, and its gradient with respect to vertex positions (required for the forces) is easily found in the literature. However, the Hessian of the bend angle, which is required to compute the associated force Jacobians is not documented in the literature. Force Jacobians are required for efficient numerics (e.g., implicit time stepping, Newton-based energy minimization) and are thus highly desirable. Readily available computations of the force Jacobian, such as those produced by symbolic algebra systems, or by autodifferentiation codes, are expensive to compute and therefore less useful. We present compact, easily reproducible, closed form expressions for the Hessian of the bend angle. Compared to automatic differentiation, we measure up to 7x speedup for the evaluation of the bending forces and their Jacobians.},

abstract = {In this paper we introduce a discrete shell model describing the behavior of thin flexible structures, such as hats, leaves, and aluminum cans, which are characterized by a curved undeformed configuration. Previously such models required complex continuum mechanics formulations and correspondingly complex algorithms. We show that a simple shell model can be derived geometrically for triangle meshes and implemented quickly by modifying a standard cloth simulator. Our technique convincingly simulates a variety of curved objects with materials ranging from paper to metal, as we demonstrate with several examples including a comparison of a real and simulated falling hat.},

Real time applications ranging from mesh smoothing and parameterization to fluid solvers and solid mechanics can greatly benefit from these, evidence our example applications of geometric flow and fluid simulation running on NVIDIA's GeForce FX.},

PARDISO uses a combination of left-and right-looking Level-3 BLAS supernode techniques to exploit pipelining parallelism. It delivers up to 960Mflop/s on COMPAQ Alpha ES40 (667MHz) for irregular problems and sparse matrix factorization has been clocked up at a speedup of 7 on an 8-node SGI Origin 2000. The paper gives an overview of the algorithm, performance results and the integration of the solver into complex industrial simulation tools. Finally, an example is discussed inherently (due to the design goal) producing linear systems close to singularity.}
